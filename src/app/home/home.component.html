Welcome to Nanoseconds.us <br> 
A nanosecond (ns or nsec) is one billionth  of a second ….wondering why this site is called nanoseconds.us ? because in life people are usually limited by amount of time they have to accomplish tasks. For example, you might be working on your home improvement project, going to a family vacation or simply building a very cool app but you always have limited time and resources to dedicate to your project. The time constraint is something that is very critical to success or failure of completing a task. For example, in many Olympic sports (such as swimming or running) the person that is able to get to the finish line first then is viewed as the champion/successful.  People sometimes view time in correlation to how important something is to them. For example, if you want something done asap then it means it’s very important to you. In my case as a DeveOps engineer I work on CI/CD pipeline, automating redundant tasks and monitoring and alerting of systems. The importance of time and being able to identify a problem and fixing it quickly is very important.
